# IPA Symbols

## Introduction

We want to make a system for easily finding the pronunciation of words so we can more easily find words that rhyme.
Once we have parsed a word to this new system it should be completely phonetic, we don't want to have to look at the next symbol so no aa or ng.
make everything phonetic, but we want to use chars we can type with keyboard.

## Vowels

### Open and Closed vowels

a == closed a from 'gak'
aa == open a from 'ga/gaak'
same for e, o and u
i = i in 'lig'
ie = ie in 'lieg' (for some reason its not ligen)

special symbol for schwa? maybe a 0

### Duplicates

(try to take first sound alphabetically)
ei == ei/ij
au == au/ou
eu, ui, oe all the same

### Basic

* a, gak
* á, gaak/ga
* i, lig
* í, lieg
* e, leg
* é, leeg, le
* o, log, leau
* ó, loog, lo
* u, lug
* ú, luug/ lu

### Dipthongs

* ä = au/ou
* ü = ui
* ï = ij
* ö = oe
* ë = eu

## Dipthong on w

* ê = eeuw
* î = ieuw

## Dipthong on i

* A = ai
* O = oi
* Á = aai
* Ó = ooi
* Ö = oei

## long vowels

oeu = uu (long u)

## Consonants

### New Symbols

* ñ = ng (alt-gr + n)
* g = g, voiced
* æ = g, unvoiced (altgr + z it looks like an x which is the ipa symbol)
* r  = r, flap
* ®  = r, g-like
* R  = r, tril
* þ  = r, american (alt-gr t)
* tj = ð (alt-gr d)

Symbols for foreign sounds are probably undesired, we have no way of knowing if jam = zjem or jam.

### Conversion Rules

* ch = g
* sch at end of word (legendarisch) = s
* y as consonant = j
* qu = kw
